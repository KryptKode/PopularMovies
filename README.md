# PopularMovies
This app fetches popular movies, using the TheMovieDB API.

* To fetch popular movies, you will use the API from -

```
http://themoviedb.org
```

* If you donâ€™t already have an account, you will need to
create one in order to request an API Key.

* In your request for a key, state that your usage
will be for educational/non-commercial use.
You will also need to provide some personal information to complete the request.
Once you submit your request, you should receive your key via email shortly after.

* Once you obtain your key, navigate to
```
PopularMovies/gradle.properties
```

Place your API key where it says `"YOUR API KEY GOES HERE"`
